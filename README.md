# Creact React App + Babel Plugin Macros

This is an example of how you can use
[Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) with
[Babel Plugin Macros](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros).

It demonstrates not only using one of the many
[published macros](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:babel-plugin-macros)
(specifically [`ms.macro`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms.macro)), but also
[how to write](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros/blob/master/other/docs/author.md)
and use your own with the `evil.macro.js` example.

[It even works in codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/kentcdodds/cra-macro-example).
(However, due to caching issues, modifying the macro itself on codesandbox is
not currently working. Feel free to
[file an issue on codesandbox about this](https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandbox-client/issues/new/choose))
